 Uncertainties for transitions involving quasibound levels modified to:
                    SQRT{(u(i;exp)**2 + ( 0.20*width)**2}
 Fit uses standard  1/[uncertainty(i)]**2  data weighting
 Non-linear fits are allowed a maximum of  CYCMAX= 100 cycles

 For state   1X
    integrate from   RMIN= 1.00   to   RMAX= 10.00   with mesh   RH= 0.00500

 State 1X represented by an MLR(p=25, q= 4) potential defined in terms of
 ========  exponent coefficient:  beta(R)= betaINF*y* +(1-y*)*Sum{beta_i*y4^i}
                                                                for  i= 0 -  9
           with radial expansion variable:   yq = (R^q - Re^q)/(R^q + Re^q)
    uLR inverse-power terms incorporate DS-type damping with   rhoAB= 0.8777032
        defined to give very short-range  Dm(r)*Cm/r^m  behaviour   r^{-1.0}
        Dm(r)= [1 - exp(- 3.30(rhoAB*r)/m - 0.423(rhoAB*r)^2/sqrt{m})]^{m-1.0}

                    These constants yield:   betaINF=  2.4008776713
 Non-Adiabatic centrifugal BOB fx. are scaled by  M(1)/M(A)  and expanded as:
     t_nad(Zn;r) = t(inf)*y3 + (1 - y3)*Sum{t_i * [y3]^i}   for  i= 0 to  6
       with Zn-atom radial expansion variable:   y3 = (R^3 - Re^3)/(R^3 + Re^3)
