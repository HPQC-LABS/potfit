 Use experimental data input file:  ./DATA_c-a_05-04-13.4         
 Uncertainties for transitions involving quasibound levels modified to:
                    SQRT{(u(i;exp)**2 + ( 0.20*width)**2}
 For electrically homonuclear molecules, BO correction functions are the same
     for both atoms, so only the first sets of correction coefficients
     UA(s) and TA(s) are used, and the mass scaling factors are sums over
     the two individual atoms.
 Fit uses standard  1/[uncertainty(i)]**2  data weighting
 Non-linear fits are allowed a maximum of  CYCMAX= 100 cycles

 For state   a3 
    integrate from   RMIN= 2.20   to   RMAX= 50.00   with mesh   RH= 0.00500
